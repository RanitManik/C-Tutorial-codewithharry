# Chapter 4 - Practice Set

1. Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number `n`.
2. Write a program to print a multiplication table of 10 in reversed order.
3. A `do-while` loop is executed:
    - At least once
    - At least twice
    - At most once

4. What can be done using one type of loop can also be done using the other two types of loops â€“ True or False?

5. Write a program to sum the first ten natural numbers using a `while` loop.

6. Write a program to implement program 5 using `for` and `do-while` loop.

7. Write a program to calculate the sum of the numbers occurring in the multiplication table of 8. (Consider 8x1 to
   8x10)

8. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using `for` loop.

9. Repeat question 8 using a `while` loop.

10. Write a program to check whether a given number is prime or not using loops.

11. Implement question 10 using other types of loops.
