# Chapter 7 - Practice Set

1. Create an array of 10 numbers. Verify using pointer arithmetic that `(ptr+2)` points to the third element where `ptr`
   is a pointer pointing to the first element of the array.

2. If `S[3]` is a 1-D array of integers, then `*(S+3)` refers to the third element:
    - True
    - False
    - Depends

3. Write a program to create an array of 10 integers and store a multiplication table of 5 in it.

4. Repeat problem 3 for a general input provided by the user using `scanf()`.

5. Write a program containing a function that reverses the array passed to it.

6. Write a program containing functions that count the number of positive integers in an array.

7. Create an array of size 3x10 containing multiplication tables of the numbers 2, 7, and 9, respectively.

8. Repeat problem 7 for custom input given by the user.

9. Create a three-dimensional array and print the address of its elements in increasing order.
