# Chapter 1 - Practice Set

1. Calculate the area of a rectangle.

    - To calculate the area with hardcoded inputs, you can declare variables for length and width and then use them in
      your calculations.

    - For user-supplied inputs, use functions like `scanf` in C to take input from the user. Ensure you prompt the user
      for input clearly.

2. Calculate the area of a circle and the volume of a cylinder

    - For the area of a circle, use the formula `area = π * r * r`, and for the volume of a cylinder, use the
      formula `volume = π * r * r * h`. Ensure you prompt the user for the necessary inputs.

3. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

    - Use the conversion formula `F = (C * 9/5) + 32` to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. Again, prompt the user for
      input.

4. Calculate simple interest

    - The formula for simple interest is `SI = (P * R * T) / 100`, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of
      interest,
      and T is the time in years. Implement this formula in your program, and prompt the user for the input values.

    - Remember to include comments in your code, follow best coding practices, and ensure readability. If you encounter
      any
      issues or have specific questions about your code, feel free to ask for clarification!
